    [Verse 1]
    Short cut to a quick buck is working all the time
    Renting out your mind and saving every dime
    'Cause when ten of those combine they cross a sacred line
    And go from pocket change to a gold mine
    
    She said she'd be down to hanging out
    With her parents out of town she was hoping I'm around
    For a party at her vacant place
    
    I said I'd come; showed up and felt out of place
    So I headed home
    That's when she text my phone and ask me where
    I was and when I said I was gone
    She broke my spine
    And in that pain
    I realized every dime I'd ever saved wasn't worth anything
    
    [Pre-Chorus]
    What's the drive in being alive if you don't know who you are?
    What's the fun in getting drunk if you can't take it too far?
    Yeah, my friends are saying I've been wasting all my weekends contemplating
    If it's me or the booze that really gets wasted
    I don't even taste it
    When I'm throwing back shots as if its a race then
    Quickly chase them
    
    [Chorus]
    But without a mouth I'm so down
    But my hometown it only makes me feel alone
    And just when I
    
    [Verse 2]
    Hometown girls are my greatest fear
    So in a couple days I'll be off to college for another year
    Thinkin' I'm gettin' away by hitting the road
    Somehow she make it to all of my shows now where can I go?
    
    Girl it's a simple a matter
    Put your painted finger on my tongue
    So I can taste the lacquer
    And relive each door that you have touched
    
    And then she split my lips
    And for three whole days
    I tried to speak but everyone agreed
    They couldn't hear a word I'd say

    [Pre-Chorus]
    What's the drive in being alive if you don't know who you are?
    What's the fun in getting drunk if you can't take it too far?
    I'm singing oh I don't know
    Take me anywhere but home
    
    [Chorus]
    Without a mouth I'm so down
    But my hometown it only makes me feel alone
    And just when I think I'm in the clear she hook her hair behind her ears and said I'm
    Going down
    She said baby it's okay you feel the way you do if you keep it to yourself
    
    [Bridge]
    Life is a bitch with no mouth and no lips
    But it sure ain't no fun with no teeth and no tongue
    Life is a bitch with no mouth and no lips
    But it sure ain't no fun with no teeth and no tongue
    Life is a bitch with no mouth and no lips I said
    Life is a bitch with no mouth and no lips I said
    Life is a bitch with no mouth and no lips
    
    [Chorus]
    Without a mouth I'm so down
    But my hometown it only makes me feel alone
    Then just when I think I'm in the clear
    She hook her hair behind her ears
    Says babe are you aware
    Of who I am?

    [Verse 1]
    The day I turn 23, I'm getting married
    And shortly after, I'm getting buried
    Pick up the pace, you know I got big plans
    I'm talking dinner with friends, shit, shave, then six feet of sand
    At least that's the plan

    [Verse 2]
    Once I lit it, they said you'll regret it
    Consequence as thin as smoke
    I swore to god I won't
    This stuff is tough, it's got a lot more than you bargained for
    And you have a hard time doing things you do
    When you got so much more than you wanted to

    [Chorus]
    My friends are wasted
    And I don't even care
    I'm in my basement
    Texting girls that aren't even real

    [Post-Chorus]
    My youth is gone and I know it
    I've pushed it too far, I've outgrown it

    [Verse 3]
    It seems you and me have got a tendency
    To see past common deeds and formalities
    Lying in the center of the floor
    You and me and our 4/4
    You and me and our 8 bars
    Wasting time before we know it's ours

    [Chorus]
    My friends are wasted
    And I don't even care
    I'm in my basement
    Texting girls that aren't even real

    [Post-Chorus]
    My youth is gone and I know it

    My youth is fine
    Until you waste my fucking time
    What a waste of fucking time
    When you're telling these bitches you love 'em
    'Cause you wanna fuck 'em, then pay 'em no mind
    But what could be missing with pissin' Blue Ribbon
    And talkin' 'bout women like 24/7, is this shit not hitting, my bro?
    Is this how you want it to go?

    [Outro]
    First or last, somewhere you've ashed
    The cigarette that's gonna take you down
    First or last, somewhere you've ashed
    The cigarette that's gonna take you down

    Returning to my face

    It's the only damn thing
    That's been missing from my day
    Cuz love in itself is an ill guided blade
    Missing it's mark
    It cuts straight through my veins
    It's the tracks, the train
    It's you in the way

    [Chorus]
    My god
    What if something happened to her?
    I couldn't even explain
    She's watching me break up the gang

    She says only the lonely people in my life saw me lost in the moment
    And down on my knees as I beg and I plead
    For some time in your sheets so I can get what I need
    Oh yeah

    Straight struck by her figure
    Plot worsen shower curtain as she pulls bernard's trigger

    Oh yeah

    But late in the night, I'm wondering like who are you?
    Are you, baby
    The thorn in my side, or just my type?

    Bad love, too much, your touch, my lonely heart can't get enough, oh

    Frequency of quickly coming
    To make me feel like I'm yours

    How come everything important, only happens when I'm dormant?

    Yet I always catch you falling back
    On hockey boys in baseball caps

    Cus I can't speak my mind unless I'm fucked up
    April thirty '97 in the cut
    And I can't speak my mind unless I'm gone
    I'm gone
    I can't speak my mind unless
    I'm gone (x7)

    [Chorus]
    I said listen, this ain't me, yeah, yeah
    I ain't ever shown my teeth, yeah, yeah
    Listen, this ain't me, yeah, yeah
    I ain't ever shown my teeth, yeah, no

    [Bridge]
    And now a roll cage in a corvette
    Keep Lukey sitting safely on the DVP
    Hit the 401
    Pushing 143
    They want a ride back home
    And I say listen man I only got two seats

    [Outro]
    You might've made it to the drake bro
    But you ain't ever caught this wave though
    Yeah (x4)
